can report their location, when they are moving somewhere. There giving chance to citizens, free online

These are the tools & technologies that we used to develop the E- health system.
We used, PHP, HTML, BOOTSTRAP, NODE JS and Flutter with dart language to do the front end 
development part by creating a web application and the mobile application.
1) (Mobile application) flutter with dart language
We are using flutter with dart language to develop our E- health mobile application. The reason 
that we choose flutter is,
• The mobile application is run on both android and iOS. (can developed cross platform 
apps)
• Hot reload
• Ready to use widgets.
• Simple platform.
• Attractive UI designs.
2) (web application)
We use PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap to create the E-health web application.
3) Node JS
We are using Node.js to develop the application programing interface (API). Because, there are 
huge number of free tools, high performance, easy to learn and use etc.
We are using express js, core js, bcrypt.js etc as the supported middleware technologies.
Those are explaining in follow.
